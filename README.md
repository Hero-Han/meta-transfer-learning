# meta-transfer-learning
This repository is the official implementation of the L@S 2022 Paper entitled "Meta Transfer Learning for Early Success Prediction in MOOCs" written by [Vinitra Swamy](http://github.com/vinitra), Mirko Marras, Tanja Käser

Experiments are located in `scripts/`. Models can be found in `models/`.

Extract relevant features sets (`BouroujeniEtAl`, `MarrasEtAl`, `LalleConati`, and `ChenCui`) through our lab's EDM 2021 contribution on [benchmarks for feature predictive power](https://github.com/epfl-ml4ed/flipped-classroom).

## Contributing 

This code is provided for educational purposes and aims to facilitate reproduction of our results, and further research 
in this direction. We have done our best to document, refactor, and test the code before publication.

If you find any bugs or would like to contribute new models, training protocols, etc, please let us know.

Please feel free to file issues and pull requests on the repo and we will address them as we can.
